### Pinned Projects

| Project Link | Date | Language | Area | Project Description |
|---------|-----------------|-------|---------------------|---------------|
 üìà[Optiver-Volatility Prediction](https://github.com/AnabelGeraldine/Optiver_VolatilityPrediction_Project?tab=readme-ov-file) | May 2024 | Python, R | Time Series, Machine Learning, Financial Data | Developed a tool to predict future financial data volatility using R. Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing and analysis, experimented with multiple time series models such as Holt-Winters and ARIMA-GARCH, and deployed the final model via a Shiny app to support real-time trading decisions. |
|üíª[Optimal ASX Stocks Allocation](https://github.com/AnabelGeraldine/ASX_Portfolio_Optimization) | November 2023 | Python | Portfolio optimization, Financial Maths libraries | focuses on portfolio optimization and risk management by analyzing financial metrics such as simple returns, means, and covariance matrices using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy. It explores optimization techniques under constraints like no short selling, enhancing problem-solving and decision-making in uncertain market conditions. Additionally, the project incorporates visualizations of efficient frontiers and risk-return profiles, integrating risk-free assets to refine investment strategies. |
|üåç[SA2s in Greater Sydney Analysis](https://github.com/AnabelGeraldine/GreaterSydney_Analysis/tree/main) | May 2023 | SQL, Python | MySQL, Postgresql, Python, spatial data | Analyzed resource distribution across Greater Sydney by integrating data on business density, transport stops, schools, and income levels. Using SQL and Python, key metrics were computed with z-scores and logistic transformations to assess regional disparities. An interactive geospatial visualization highlights areas needing improved resource allocation for urban planning and policymaking. |
|üè°[Scalable SQL Query Optimization on Airbnb Datasets](https://github.com/AnabelGeraldine/SQL-Query-Optimization---Airbnb-Datasets) | May 2025 | SQL | SQL (PostgreSQL, HiveQL/Spark SQL), Databricks, Delta Lake, Execution Plan Analysis | Conducted performance tuning and indexing for complex analytical SQL queries on Airbnb datasets of varying sizes using PostgreSQL and Databricks. Analyzed query performance for tasks such as review trends, host quality metrics, and amenity-based filtering. Demonstrated significant runtime improvements (up to 80%) through index design, execution plan interpretation, and scalability comparisons. Evaluated trade-offs between relational indexing and file-level optimizations in Spark-based systems.|
|üìä[Portfolio Optimisation with Market Data](https://github.com/AnabelGeraldine/PortfolioOptimization_w_MarketData) | 02 November 2024 | Python | Jupyternotebook | This project applies portfolio optimization techniques using real-world market data to maximize returns while minimizing risk. It explores static and dynamic investment strategies, incorporating Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and risk aversion modeling to optimize asset allocation. The results highlight that dynamic portfolios adapt better to market changes, while static portfolios may perform better in stable conditions.|
|ü¶™[Abalone Age Prediction with R](https://github.com/AnabelGeraldine/Abalone_Age_Prediction) | November 2023 | R | visualization ggplot, correlation test, backward, forward, and log-linear models | Predicts the age of abalone using statistical modeling and machine learning techniques in RStudio. The analysis involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature selection, followed by model development using regression techniques to optimize predictive accuracy. Performance was evaluated using metrics like RMSE and R-squared, with insights visualized to communicate key findings effectively.|




### Other Projects 
| Project Link | Date | Language | Area | Project Description |
|---------|-----------------|-------|---------------------|---------------|
|üë©‚Äçüéì[Academic Performance Analysis - DATA2X02](https://github.com/AnabelGeraldine/AcademicPerformanceAnalysis_DATA2X02) | September 2023 | R | ggplot, html | This project analyzes factors influencing academic performance in DATA2X02 students at the University of Sydney, focusing on study habits, sleep patterns, work commitments, and course load. Using RStudio with tidyverse, dplyr, and ggplot2, the data was cleaned, visualized, and statistically analyzed to identify key performance drivers. The findings suggest that study hours, sleep time, and assignment submission habits significantly impact WAM, while factors like social media usage and part-time work show weaker correlations.|
|üíµ[Wealth & Health Correlation](https://github.com/AnabelGeraldine/Wealth_Health_Correlation) | October 2022 | Python in spyder | visualization, ML | This project examines the relationship between wealth, health, and social outcomes, focusing on crude death rates, literacy, and suicide rates. Using Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib), various regression models, including Linear Regression, KNN, and Bayesian Linear Regression, were applied to analyze correlations and predict crude death rates. |
|üíª[Comparative Analysis of Classification Algorithms](https://github.com/AnabelGeraldine/ComparativeAnalysis_of_ClassificationAlgorithms) | May 2024 | Weka & Python | Comparative analysis, ML | This project compares machine learning classifiers like KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to evaluate their predictive performance on two datasets: the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset and the Room Occupancy Dataset. Using Python and Weka, models were tested with 10-fold cross-validation, and their accuracy was analyzed.|
|üßÆ[Derivative Pricing Methods (MC&FD)](https://github.com/AnabelGeraldine/Derivative_Pricing_Methods) | September 2024 |Python | Numpy | This project explores Monte Carlo simulations and Finite Difference Methods (FDM) for pricing financial derivatives, comparing their accuracy and efficiency. Using Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib), Monte Carlo simulated asset price paths, while FDM numerically solved partial differential equations for option pricing.
