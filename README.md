# Anabel's Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! Here, you'll find a curated showcase of my projects, highlighting my journey and achievements in the field of data analysis and modeling. Dive into detailed summaries that explore the challenges I‚Äôve tackled and the solutions I‚Äôve crafted across various data-centric projects.

### Main Projects

| Project Link | Date | Language | Area | Project Description |
|---------|-----------------|-------|---------------------|---------------|
 üìà[Optiver-Volatility Prediction](https://github.com/AnabelGeraldine/Optiver_VolatilityPrediction_Project?tab=readme-ov-file) | May 2024 | Python, R | Time Series, Machine Learning, Financial Data | Developed a tool to predict future financial data volatility using R. Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing and analysis, experimented with multiple time series models such as Holt-Winters and ARIMA-GARCH, and deployed the final model via a Shiny app to support real-time trading decisions. |
|üíª[Optimal ASX Stocks Allocation](https://github.com/AnabelGeraldine/ASX_Portfolio_Optimization) | November 2023 | Python | Portfolio optimization, Financial Maths libraries | focuses on portfolio optimization and risk management by analyzing financial metrics such as simple returns, means, and covariance matrices using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy. It explores optimization techniques under constraints like no short selling, enhancing problem-solving and decision-making in uncertain market conditions. Additionally, the project incorporates visualizations of efficient frontiers and risk-return profiles, integrating risk-free assets to refine investment strategies. |
|üåç[SA2s in Greater Sydney Analysis](https://github.com/AnabelGeraldine/GreaterSydney_Analysis/tree/main) | May 2023 | SQL, Python | MySQL, Postgresql, Python, spatial data | Analyzed resource distribution across Greater Sydney by integrating data on business density, transport stops, schools, and income levels. Using SQL and Python, key metrics were computed with z-scores and logistic transformations to assess regional disparities. An interactive geospatial visualization highlights areas needing improved resource allocation for urban planning and policymaking. |
|üìä[Portfolio Optimisation with Market Data](https://github.com/AnabelGeraldine/PortfolioOptimization_w_MarketData) | 02 November 2024 | Python | Jupyternotebook | This project applies portfolio optimization techniques using real-world market data to maximize returns while minimizing risk. It explores static and dynamic investment strategies, incorporating Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and risk aversion modeling to optimize asset allocation. The results highlight that dynamic portfolios adapt better to market changes, while static portfolios may perform better in stable conditions.|
|ü¶™[Abalone Age Prediction with R](https://github.com/AnabelGeraldine/Abalone_Age_Prediction) | November 2023 | R | visualization ggplot, correlation test, backward, forward, and log-linear models | Predicts the age of abalone using statistical modeling and machine learning techniques in RStudio. The analysis involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature selection, followed by model development using regression techniques to optimize predictive accuracy. Performance was evaluated using metrics like RMSE and R-squared, with insights visualized to communicate key findings effectively.|
